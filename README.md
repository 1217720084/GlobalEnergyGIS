# GlobalEnergyGIS.jl

Generates input data for energy models on renewable energy in arbitrary world regions using public datasets. Written in Julia 1.x. 

## Installation

If you are on Windows, first restart Julia as administrator (right click on the Julia shortcut in the Start Menu and select "[More\\]Run as Administrator"). Administrator privileges are not required later to use the package, just for the installation step.

Type `]` to enter Julia's package mode, then:

```
(v1.1) pkg> add https://github.com/niclasmattsson/GlobalEnergyGIS
``` 

Grab some coffee, because installing and compiling dependencies can take quite some time to run.
